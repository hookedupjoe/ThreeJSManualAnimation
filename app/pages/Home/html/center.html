      Why manual control?
    </div>
    In this application we desire to control 3D character animations using a "puppet string" that can be pulled manually or attached to something like a music response band / volume level, etc.

      How it works
    </div>
    To control an animation that is based on time, you have to "become the time".  To do that you have to continually whipe out the time that the mixer is tracking and tell it what time it is, as though the animation is starting at that frame and nothing else has happened.  The description is longer than the code.
